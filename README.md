# Hayne's Cards
> Creating an accessible React application, including backend and frontend for managing business cards

## Creating a new project

First use [create-react-app] to create your project:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

> npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, if you have an older version you will need
> to install `create-react-app` globally instead

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
cd my-app
```


> to install all framework use `npm i --force` inside real-app-fron and inside real-app-server
```sh
npm i --force 
```

> Note that you must have mongoDB on your computer:
[MongoDB installation](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/#installation)

## Run The Project
> Open 2 Terminal
```sh
(Ctrl+Shift+`)
```
> In first terminal enter to `real-app-front` and start
```sh
cd real-app-front
npm run start
```

> In other terminal enter to `real-app-server` and start the server
```sh
cd real-app-server
npm run dev
```
